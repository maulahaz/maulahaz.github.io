The Jekyll publishing system used by GitHub Pages expects you to have an assets directory, and that’s where image files should be placed. By convention they go into an images subdirectory (full path /docs/assets/images but that’s not a firm requirement. They can be anywhere in the /docs/assets path.

Create a directory called /docs/assets
If you haven’t yet created an assets directory, read Adding an assets directory to GitHub Pages and follow those steps to create a directory at /docs/assets.
Upload images to the /docs/assets directory
On GitHub, navigate to the /docs/assets directory.

Click the Add file button, then choose Upload files
